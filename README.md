## ER-visits-Dashboard
The Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard project is essential for providing valuable insights into the ER's operational performance. It aims to enhance the understanding of key metrics related to patient wait times, demographics, department referrals, satisfaction scores, and overall ER traffic. By analyzing various factors, the dashboard enables stakeholders to identify patterns, optimize resource allocation, and enhance patient satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to contribute to a more effective and patient-centered emergency healthcare environment.
## Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from a fake dataset available on Data World [Download here](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data). This synthetic dataset mimics real-world scenarios, providing a foundation for meaningful analysis without compromising privacy or sensitive information.
## Tools Used 
- Excel - This tool was employed for data cleaning and preparation of the large data set

- Tableau - Tableau, a powerful visualization tool, was then used to create the interactive dashboard.

These tools were chosen for their accessibility, user-friendly interfaces, and ability to handle both data processing and visualization tasks seamlessly.
## Data Cleaning /Preparation
In the intial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. importing into tableau.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Questions the Dashboard Answers
Patient Wait Times: What is the average wait time for patients, categorized by the hour of the day and day of the week?
Patient Demographics: How is the patient population distributed across age groups and months?
Diversity in Patients: What is the racial composition of the patients visiting the ER?
Referral Patterns: Which departments are referring patients to the ER?
Satisfaction Scores: What is the average satisfaction score reported by patients (on a scale of 0-10)?
Gender Distribution: How is the patient population distributed by gender?
Total ER Visits: What is the overall count of patients who have visited the ER?
## Data Analysis
- Which day experiences the longest wait times for patients?

The data reveals that highest total number of patient wait times occur on Fridays, suggesting a need for further analysis. Allocating resources to address this day's delays can optimize operations and enhance patient experience.

- What age bracket exhibits the greatest patient volume?

This visualization prompts additional inquiries, such as determining the factors influencing the prevalence of individuals aged 19 to 65 among ER visitors and assessing the implications of this demographic distribution on ER resource allocation and healthcare planning for further analysis.

The distribution of ages provides insights into the demographic makeup of patients in the ER. This indicates that the age group spanning from 19 to 65 constitutes the largest portion of ER visitors.

- what is the total satisfaction rate of patients in the ER within the range of 0-10?  Average satisfaction scores offer a measure of the quality of ER services.

The data examines the overall satisfaction level of ER patients within the 0-10 rating range. Average satisfaction scores serve as an indicator of ER service quality. Based on the line graph, the average score stands at 4.99 out of 10, indicating a relatively low level of satisfaction among patients.

- what is the aggregate count of patients referred to the ER group by department? Department referral analysis provides insights into collaboration between different medical units.

## Recommendations
1. The data indicates a relatively low satisfaction rate among ER patients, with an average score of 4.99 out of 10. To address this, it's crucial for ER administrators to conduct thorough assessments of patient feedback and experiences. Implementing strategies to enhance communication, reduce wait times, and improve the quality of care can significantly contribute to elevating patient satisfaction levels. Regularly soliciting and acting upon patient feedback can help identify areas for improvement and ultimately enhance the overall ER experience for patients.
2. The hospital needs to allocate resources judiciously based on insights gleaned from the analysis. Adjust staffing levels, equipment distribution, and facility layout to accommodate the demographic trends and patient needs identified in the data.
3. Establish a system for ongoing data collection and analysis to monitor key metrics and track the impact of implemented changes. This will help create deeper analysis and answer further future questions.
